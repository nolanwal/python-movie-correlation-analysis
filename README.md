# Correlation Analysis of Film Industry Data with Python

This project explores the relationships between key film industry variables, such as budget, gross earnings, votes, and company, using Python. Correlation analysis and visualizations reveal insights about financial performance and investment outcomes.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)  
- **Key fields:** `budget`, `gross`, `votes`, `company`, `year`, `runtime`

## Skills & Tools

- Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`)  
- Data cleaning, missing value handling, type conversion  
- Correlation analysis (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall)  
- Scatter plots, heatmaps, and visualizations  
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis  

## Analyses Performed

- **Initial data review:** basic statistics, duplicates, missing values  
- **Correlation analysis:** relationships between budget, gross revenue, votes, and other features  
- **Visualizations:** scatter plots of budget vs. gross, votes vs. gross, correlation heatmap  
- **Insights by variable:** identified strongest positive correlations  
- **Data cleaning & preparation:** converting data types, dropping irrelevant fields, handling missing values  

## Key Insights

- Budget and gross revenue have a strong positive correlation.  
- Votes show a moderate positive correlation with gross revenue.  
- Company names have minimal correlation with gross revenue.  
- High-budget films generally generate higher earnings, but exceptions exist.
